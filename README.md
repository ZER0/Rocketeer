Rocketeer
=========

Rocketeer is an Sublime Text 2 plugin for Add-on SDK.
At the moment it's only provide a simple autocompletition for modules when
a module's id is typed in a `require` statement, the idea is extending with
different features.

In order to make it works, sets the Add-on SDK path in the preferences.

Package Control supports is coming.
