Rocketeer
=========

Rocketeer is an Sublime Text 2 plugin for the Firefox Add-on SDK.
At the moment it only provides simple autocompletion for modules when
a module's id is typed in a `require` statement. In the future we will be adding more features including snippets.

In order to make it work you need to set the Add-on SDK path in the preferences.

Package Control support is coming.
